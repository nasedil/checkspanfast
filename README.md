# Check Span Fast

This program in written as an attempt to find a Strassen-like algorithm for cube multiplication operation.  The operation is a generalization of matrix multiplication, it procuduces 3-dimensional *n* by *n* by *n* array from three 3-dimensional *n* by *n* by *n* arrays.

The puzzle of finding such algorithm could be formulated differently, this is just one of ways.

The program was written as a part of master thesis in informatics "Exact algorithms for MAX-2SAT and MAX-3SAT via multidimensional matrix multiplication" in 2013—2015 by Eugene Petkevich (Yevgheni Petkevich) in University of Bergen.
